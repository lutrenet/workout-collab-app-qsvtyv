You want to build a workout group app with features for workout uploads, progress tracking, leaderboards, and user login. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **User Authentication:** Implement a basic login/signup flow.\n*   **Group Creation/Joining:** Allow users to create workout groups or join existing ones.\n*   **Workout Uploads:** Enable group admins (or all members, depending on your preference) to upload workout routines.\n*   **Progress Tracking:** Provide a way for members to log their progress on each workout and view others' progress.\n*   **Leaderboard:** Display a leaderboard based on workout progress or other metrics.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#4CAF50` (Green for main actions and branding)\n    *   Secondary: `#FFC107` (Amber for highlights and accents)\n    *   Accent: `#9C27B0` (Purple for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#E8F5E9` (Very light green for subtle emphasis)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Examine existing files:** Use `read_file_tree()` to get a better understanding of the project structure.\n2.  **Implement User Authentication:** Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to include login/signup buttons.\n3.  **Create Group Functionality:** Create a new file `app/(tabs)/groups.tsx` to handle group creation and joining.\n4.  **Implement Workout Uploads:** Modify `app/(tabs)/groups.tsx` to allow workout uploads.\n5.  **Implement Progress Tracking:** Modify `app/(tabs)/groups.tsx` to allow members to log their progress.\n6.  **Implement Leaderboard:** Modify `app/(tabs)/groups.tsx` to display a leaderboard.\n7.  **Remove modalDemos:** Remove the modalDemos array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T12:50:21.507595"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive workout group app with user authentication, group management, workout uploads, progress tracking, and leaderboards.
